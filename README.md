A simple docker wrapper for [html-proofer][html-proofer].

## Versionning

Since [html-proofer][html-proofer] seams to use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/),
we will use the format `v<html-proofer version>-<our version>`.

For example :

| html-proofer version | Our release version | Final version |
|----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| v3.18.8              | 0                   | v3.18.8-0      |
| v3.18.8              | 1                   | v3.18.8-1      |
| v3.19.0              | 0                   | v3.19.0-0      |
